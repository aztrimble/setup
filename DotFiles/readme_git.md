# GIT Notes
This directory contains git configuration files. In addition, this README.md file contains my notes and thoughts about git. 
## Setup Notes
- When more than one user are using the same machine you can set up commands to customize the commits (i.e. include user name and email).
## Commands
Reminder of commands I don't need very often so I won't remember them without writing them down
- rebase

## Remote Hosts
- GitHub
    -- most common?
- GitLab
- GitButler


## ROS
Eventually the following might be needed for ROS workspaces.
```
*/*
!src/
```
