# New Install? Here's what you'll need.
## Updates
Make sure everything is updated

```sudo apt update ```

```sudo apt upgrade```

```sudo apt dist-upgrade```

```sudo apt autoremove```

```sudo apt autoclean```

## Downloading tools
These are likely already installed, but its probably a good idea just to be sure.

```sudo apt install build-essentials```

```sudo apt install git```

```sudo apt install curl```

```sudo apt install wget```

## Google Chrome?
You can skip this step, but for web testing or drinking the gmail, docs, sheets, etc. koolaid you almost might as well.

```To Do -- download with curl then use dpkg```

## nvm
Are you going to do much with javascript? If so you want nvm (package manager) and node
